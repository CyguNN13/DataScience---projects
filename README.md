These are my completed Data Science project that I have undertaken:



INDPRO Forecasting:
  With 5 unique variables I performed a series of steps (data preparation, modeling, microparameter tuning, visualization, and optimizing) to predict the INDPRO index for 4 months ahead



Diabetes Project:
  It is a research project that I have done for research purposes and to practice writing python code for modeling data structures.
  The main idea behind it was to check which physical factors of different women correlate with high risk of developing diabetes.
